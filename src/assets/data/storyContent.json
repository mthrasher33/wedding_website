      "parText": "Matt and Cecily met on OKCupid and had their first date over 2-4-1's at Liquor Lyle's. Before the date, Matt was vetted by Cecily's brother, who happened to live on the same floor as Matt during their Freshman year of college. Nathan, Cecily's brother, felt confident that Matt was just the \"weird, quirky type\" she liked. He was right! In the five years since, Matt and Cecily have enjoyed many laughs, travels, camping trips, board games, and of course, the addition of their beloved dog, June. They're excited to celebrate their love and commitment to each other alongside their family and friends this October."

They're excited to see you all, and can't wait to spend the rest of their lives together."
