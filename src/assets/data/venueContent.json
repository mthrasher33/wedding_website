      "parText": "A historic hall in Northeast Minneapolis operated by the Polish National Alliance (PNA) for over 100 years. The hall was recently purchased by the owners of the restaurant downstairs, Northeast Social. For us, the PNA hall is an old-school feature of Northeast Minneapolis, and is one of the places we walk by daily. We are excited to celebrate our marriage in a place so close to our home.<p>Of note, the hall is located on the second floor of the building above the restaurant Northeast Social. The entrance to the hall is on 4th St. NE. There is a small lot behind the building for wedding guests along with street parking. However, due to the limited space, we suggest taking transit to and from the wedding.</p>"
